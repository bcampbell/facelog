<h3>What is FaceLog?</h3>

<p>
FaceLog is a Chrome extension, developed by the Centre for the Study of
Media, Communication and Power at King's College London, to research the
information and news that people see and share when using Facebook.
</p>


<h3>What information does FaceLog collect?</h3>
<p>
Once you download and enable the FaceLog Chrome extension, and open
Facebook on your computer, FaceLog will capture the basic information about
what you see in your Facebook newsfeed - the source of the post, the
date/time posted, a description, a link and how much the post has been
liked and shared.
</p>


<h3>Who is collecting this information and why?</h3>
<p>
The information is being collected by the Centre for the Study of Media,
Communication and Power at King's College London in order to better
understand what news and information people are exposed to, and engage
with, on Facebook. More and more people now get their news from Facebook,
yet we know very little about what news people receive and how it is
shared. This research aims to increase our knowledge about this.
</p>


<h3>Will my name or any personal information be made public?</h3>

<p>
None of the posts collected will be used to identify individuals in any
way, and the Facebook personal information will be treated as confidential
and not shared beyond the research team. Each individual's Facebook name,
and any information that would allow a person to be identified will not be
published.
</p>

<h3>Is participation voluntary?</h3>

<p>
Your participation is completely voluntary and you can remove the extension
at any time. To remove just right click on the FaceLog icon in the bar at
the top of your browser and choose 'Remove from Chrome'.
</p>

<h3>Can anyone download the FaceLog Chrome extension?</h3>


<p>
Anyone can download the FaceLog Chrome extension, though research will not
be done on all those who download the extension. At this stage, research
will only be carried out on people who are specially invited to participate
(and given a unique ID number).
</p>

<h3>Who will have access to the information collected?</h3>

<p>
The data collected will only be available to the research team and will not
be shared externally.
</p>


<h3>How will the information be used?</h3>

<p>
The information will be used to better understand what news and information
people see and share in Facebook. It will form the basis for research
findings about different types of exposure to news and information on
Facebook. All personal information will be anonymised.
</p>


<h3>How long will the information be kept?</h3>

<p>
The personal data collected will only be held until this research is
completed.
</p>


<h3>What will you do to protect my data?</h3>

<p>
All datasets and relevant documents will be password-protected and accessed
only by the research team via staff accounts. All use of data for the
purposes of the research project will be conducted on devices on the host
institution's domain, and subject to the institution's security procedures.
</p>
