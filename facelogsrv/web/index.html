<p>
The FaceLog research project is being conducted by the Centre for the Study
of Media, Communication and Power at Kings College London, in partnership
with Ipsos MORI and Demos Think Tank, in order to better document how
people use social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. The research will
help us understand what people say and what information people receive on
social media.
</p>
<p>
The project is currently focused on the use of social media during the UK
2017 General Election campaign, and aims to  capture the extent and type of
political news and information people see and share.
</p>
<p>
As part of the project the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and
Power has developed a Chrome Extension which, once downloaded, accesses and
processes the content posted in an individual's Facebook newsfeed. None of
the posts collected will be used to identify individuals in any way, and
the Facebook personal information will be treated as confidential and not
shared beyond the research team. Each individual's Facebook name, and any
information that would allow a person to be identified will not be
published.
</p>
