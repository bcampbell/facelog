better handling of hyperfeeds (eg shared link with multiple content)
log number of likes/comments etc
only log items which are visible (ie not posted which are preloaded, but offscreen)
add a backend (background page?) to stash posts and coordinate stuff
add a gui for browsing logged posts
export to csv
