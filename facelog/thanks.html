The FaceLog Chrome Extension is part of a research project being conducted
by the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/CMCP">Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power</a> at Kings
College London, into how people use social media, such as Facebook. The
research will help us better understand what people say and what
information people receive on social media.
